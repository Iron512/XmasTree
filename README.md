# Xmas Tree
## A X-mas themed C repository
Saw a pic on the internet, wanted to do a code similar to the pic saw.

## Milestones:
It's exactly 01:00 AM of the 25th of december 2019. Repo Started

It's 01:29 AM, I ended up my mem refresh about ncurses through internet and old project. I am good to go
It's 01:31 AM, I decided to start the code listening to *Rasputin*, by *Boney M*.

It's 01:58 AM, the first tree came to life, its green and it has a base. Still no animation or decorations.

It's 02:09 AM, After *Daddy Cool*, i feel a little crazy like a fool and decide to switch on *Hit the road Jack*, by *Ray Charles*.
However the decoration are almost ready, must randomize their spawn or decide a standard pattern. Still don't know

It's 02:20 AM, the animation is completed. I opted for the standard pattern, is easy and always good looking.
It's 02:34 AM, took me more than 15 min to define the pattern. Now it's done, time to implement it

It's 02:52 AM and I just added the tree trunk. the Tree is fully functional. I will insert some greetings and then the game is done.
It's 03:11 AM and I am finished by at least 10 minutes. Still chilling to find best configuration of all parameters. Classic.
It's 03:16 AM and I am officially done. Time to rest. Which obv means pushing and chilling on the Internet for at least 2 hrs.

Good Night

## Compile
Use the *./compile.sh* in the folder and you are good to go. Execute with *./xmas*.
